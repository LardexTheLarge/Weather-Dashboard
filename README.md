# Weather-Dashboard

  ## Description

  Weather Dashboard lets user search for the weather in a specific city by using an api from Weatherbit.io and openweathermap.org. Each search can be called back with local storage and searched again. When city is searched the city shows up and current date shows up along with temp, wind, humidity and UV index with color coded intensity. With each search the forecast of the next 5 days will show up with all data related to those days. The app was made with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the 2 API's mentioned earlier.

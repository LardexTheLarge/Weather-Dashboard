# Weather-Dashboard

core - Weather Dashboard lets user search for
the weather in a specific city by using an api
from Weatherbit.io and openweathermap.org. Each search can
be called back with local storage and searched again.
When city is searched the city shows up and
current date shows up along with temp, wind, humidity
and UV index with color coded intensity. The forecast dates will
appear with users specific search.
